description: 'Generate open-ended ideas for the project.'
---

Examine the attached files in order to provide open-ended ideas for the project. They are not about programming specifically, 
but rather about the project itself, its goals, and how it can be improved or expanded. 

Things to consider:
  - Is the current state aligned with the project's goals?
  - Are there clear opportunities for improvement or expansion?
  - Could we have additional features very different from the current ones, but that complement them? For example, if 
    the project only has a CLI interface, would it make sense to add a GUI interface?
  - Are the abstractions and concepts used aligned with the domain or subject-matter of the project?
  - Could we have additional abstractions or concepts that would expand or improve the domain or subject-matter coverage?
