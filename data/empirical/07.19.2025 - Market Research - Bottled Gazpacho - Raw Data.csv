1,4,Yes because it is something i have never tried and willing to give it a go,25-34,Male,Democrat,White
2,1,I HATE soup.  Cold soup would be worse.,65+,Female,Democrat,White
3,1,i would not purchase a ready to drink gazpacho because i am not a fan of it.,35-44,Female,Democrat,Black
4,5,"It sounds healthy and if it's ready to drink and doesn't require me to do all that chopping of the vegetables, what's not to like!",55-64,Female,Democrat,White
5,3,"Like most things, I would try it at the right price. I normally don't eat gazpacho though.",35-44,Non-binary,Independent / other,Other
6,4,"Gazpacho was something that I have never tried , but I always wanted to . So I'm going to give it a 4 star , because I'm most likely would give it a great try because I know what it is . I just have never tried it and I'd like the all the ingredients in it . ",55-64,Male,Independent / other,Other
7,2,I'm not a big soup person so this doesn't appeal to me.,25-34,Male,Democrat,Other
8,4,"Very possibly, but I would want to make sure the ingredients look good and that it doesn't contain a bunch of artificial ingredients and preservatives (and the price being not too high would be nice too).",35-44,Male,Independent / other,Hispanic
9,1,"As an American, drinking soup sounds super weird to me.",35-44,Male,Democrat,White
10,1,I do not like the taste of this particular product and never understood why anyone else likes cold soup.,65+,Male,Democrat,White
11,3,I'm not really interested in a cold soup so I probably wouldn't consider this drink unless my friends or family highly recommended it.,45-54,Female,Republican,Black
12,2,I would not buy this ready to drink but might consider it as a meal side.,35-44,Male,Democrat,Black
13,2,It would probably appeal to someone who drinks something similar to a V8 but personally I would not buy this as it doesn't sound appealing at all.,45-54,Female,Republican,Hispanic
14,5,I would most definitely do so because of the convenience,25-34,Male,Independent / other,Asian
15,4,"I'd rate this idea 4 stars. I like fresh, savory options that don't need heating or prep. If the taste holds up, I'd buy it often in warmer months.",25-34,Male,Independent / other,Black
16,3,"I'd be intrigued by a bottled gazpacho, but it would depend on the price and also the freshness. Ideally, I'd want something with a very limited shelf-life and no preservatives. For instance, small batch gazpacho that is re-stocked every week.",35-44,Male,Independent / other,Asian
17,3,"Yes, I would purchase it for my family member.",35-44,Female,Democrat,Hispanic
18,5,I think that this is  a fantastic idea. I like the idea because it is completely original and there is nothing available like it in the stores. This would be a product that I would buy regularly because I cannot get it at all now. I would be very happy to think that this would be available to me and it is a product that I would buy all the time,25-34,Female,Republican,White
19,4,I would certainly try it. Gazpacho would fit into my summer meal plans quite well. Taste and ease of use (and price) would determine whether I make it a regular in the dinner rotation.,55-64,Female,Democrat,White
20,2,"likely would not try it ready made in a bottle it just seems strange to have soup in that format, but im open to trying once",25-34,Male,Independent / other,Black
21,3,I've never had a gazpacho before. I would be willing to give it a try depending on the price. I couldn't imagine paying more for it than a v8 or something like that.,35-44,Male,Independent / other,Other
22,5,"This sounds like a quick, easy, delicious,  and healthy on the go meal option. ",45-54,Female,Democrat,White
23,3,"I particularly dont like cold tomatoe products. i stray from acidic drinks
",25-34,Female,Independent / other,White
24,3,"I propensity to purchase ready-to-drink bottled gazpacho is 3 out of 5. If it wasn't too expensive, I would try it at least once. But I would only try it during the summer.
I'm concerned about the quality of the product. It shouldn't taste like tomato juice or V8. ",55-64,Male,Independent / other,White
25,5,Yes I would try it if the price were under $2 a can.,35-44,Male,Republican,White
26,1,"I don't care for gazpacho, so I would not purchase this drink.",45-54,Female,Democrat,Hispanic
27,3,I love gazpacho but usually my wife or friends make it. I’m not too sure about buying it at the market. Maybe if I knew it was fresh I would.,35-44,Male,Democrat,White
28,4,I’ve never had gazpacho but it sounds delightful. I work in an office 3 days a week so this may be something I pickup to have an easy lunch if I am pressed for time,35-44,Male,Republican,Hispanic
29,3,"At first I put down a 1 star or no answer, but then the more I thought about it, the more it would be like getting a V8.  Which is ALMOST the same thing.",35-44,Male,Democrat,Asian
30,1,"I would never purchase this since gazpacho is a cold soup and you eat it, it isn't a drink that comes from a bottle. If you are marketing a soup then phrase it as a packaged, easy to dispense cold soup. Gazpacho is not blended and is served with hearty ingredients and never blended. It sounds like you are making a vegetable juice so just market it that way and say it's gazpacho flavor.",55-64,Female,Democrat,White
31,1,"Probably a very healthy drink; however, I can't get used to the idea of drinking gazpacho (I like eating it, however, and I am assuming that this drink is a blended mixture).",55-64,Male,Independent / other,White
32,4,"When you say ""drink"" it sounds odd, it is supposed to be eaten as a cold soup. I would go for it if it would taste delicious and price was right. But maybe not market it as ""ready to drink"" but rather ready to ""consume"".",35-44,Female,Republican,Black
33,3,"Sorry, I personally would not like to drink anything like this. If it would something to use as an ingredient in cooking it would be great and something to keep on hand.",65+,Female,Democrat,Other
34,3,I have not tried it so I do not know if I like it. I would try it at least once.,25-34,Male,Independent / other,White
35,2,"I gave a 2-star rating because it's highly unlikely that I would buy it but I wouldn't rule it out completely, I could potentially see myself buying one to try it because I've never had gazpacho before. I do like the ingredients in it but I don't like cold soup and that is the main thing that turns me off and makes me not want to eat it. And I do really like that it's ready-to-drink because that makes it very easy to have it anywhere and anytime that you want and you don't have to worry about having a bowl to put it in.",45-54,Male,Independent / other,Black
36,1,I feel like this is not a product that people would want to take on the go. This is something that should be enjoyed sitting down.,45-54,Male,Democrat,Hispanic
37,4,"I don not  consume gazpacho on a regular basis, but I've had it before and I would try it again.",65+,Male,Republican,White
38,3,It sounds very flavorful so I would be potentially interested.,45-54,Male,Republican,Other
39,4,"I love gazpacho, but I am trying to quit oils, so I gave it 4 stars. My family members would probably not mind the olive oil, though. ",55-64,Female,Republican,Asian
40,2,"I mean, I like gazpacho so I think there's a > 0 chance I'd try it out once, but I have 0 faith that it would be good enough to actually have regularly. Premade bottled ready to drink soup just seems a step too far.",35-44,Male,Independent / other,Black
41,1,I give it a 1 out of 5 stars because I don’t like gazpacho.,35-44,Female,Democrat,Asian
42,1,"I would not consider it.  I don't drink gazpacho, so I don't see that I would ever buy such a product in the store.",45-54,Male,Independent / other,Other
43,2,I could see where some people might like this but it sounds disgusting for me and I would never buy it. ,35-44,Female,Republican,White
44,1,"I don't really like gazpacho so I don't think I'd ever buy this kind of product. But if I did like this, I would definitely consider buying some",35-44,Male,Independent / other,White
45,2,I don't think I would be interested in this as a ready to drink option. I would be worried about its quality. ,45-54,Male,Democrat,Black
46,5,"I've never had it before, but the ingredients sound good to me, and I'm all about convenience, so ready-to-drink is perfect. This, of course, all depends on the price.",65+,Female,Democrat,White
47,2,"No chance, I could not drink a cold tomato based drink. To me that personally does not seem very appetizing.",35-44,Male,Republican,White
48,4,"i have had gazpacho and believe it is one of the staple dishes of last 200 years but theres a decorum to it ro me personally, a bottled version does not seem so appetizing but maybe a younger first timer might enjoy.",55-64,Male,Republican,White
49,3,"This doesn't stand out to me, I may or may not try it if I saw it on a shelf.",35-44,Male,Republican,White
50,5,"Yes, I love gazpacho and have never seen a ready made version of this so I would definitely try it. ",25-34,Female,Democrat,Hispanic
