# Publications

This directory contains artifacts related to research publications associated with the TinyTroupe project.
Each publication typically has its own subdirectory named according to the publication's identifier or date. Within each subdirectory, you may find:

- Source materials
- Supplementary data
- Experimental code
- Figures and visualizations
- Presentation materials

If necessary, either this `README.md` file or a publication-specific `README.md` file will provide additional information, clarifications, context and instructions for using the materials.

If you use any of the artifacts in your own work, please cite the corresponding publication too.
