- Local Agricultural Cooperatives
- University Agricultural Departments
- Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) focused on sustainable agriculture
- Local government agricultural extension services

### 3. Risk Management Plan
Developing a comprehensive risk management plan is vital for identifying potential risks associated with climate change and outlining strategies to mitigate these risks. The plan should include:

- **Risk Assessment**: Conduct a thorough assessment of climate-related risks, including droughts, floods, and pest outbreaks.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Develop specific strategies for each identified risk, such as crop rotation, diversification, and investment in resilient crop varieties.
- **Monitoring and Review**: Establish a regular review process to monitor the effectiveness of the risk management strategies and make adjustments as necessary.

#### Table 2: Risk Management Framework

| Risk Type            | Potential Impact                               | Mitigation Strategy                          |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Drought               | Reduced crop yields                            | Implement water conservation techniques      |
| Flooding             | Crop loss and soil erosion                     | Invest in drainage systems                   |
| Pest Outbreaks       | Decreased crop quality and yield               | Use integrated pest management practices     |

### 4. Sustainable Practices
Encouraging the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices is essential for UrbanGrow to adapt to changing environmental conditions while maintaining productivity. Recommended practices include:

- **Organic Farming**: Promote organic farming techniques that reduce chemical inputs and enhance soil health.
- **Agroforestry**: Integrate trees and shrubs into agricultural landscapes to improve biodiversity and soil quality.
- **Conservation Tillage**: Implement conservation tillage practices to minimize soil disturbance and enhance carbon sequestration.

#### List of Sustainable Practices to Implement
- Crop rotation and diversification
- Cover cropping to improve soil health
- Integrated pest management to reduce chemical use
- Water-efficient irrigation systems
